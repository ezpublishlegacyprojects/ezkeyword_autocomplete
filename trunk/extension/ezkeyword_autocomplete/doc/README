Autocomplete on eZ Keyword datatype
===================================

Description
-----------
Adds an autocomplete feature on the Keywords datatype ( ezkeyword ) during content edition, based on YUI's Autocomplete component.

Features
--------

* Previously entered keywords will be shown in a suggestion drop down
* An already picked up keyword is not picked again
* Added a policy to the backend ajax view, plus a policy omit list entry. This gives the possibility to restrict access to this feature if required
* ezini check in the template will bypass the template cache, so that no template cache clearing is required when modifying something in datatype.ini
* keywords appearing twice in the database are unicified and won't appear as duplicates in the suggestion drop down
* AutocompleteKeywordsPerContentClass = disabled by default now

Configuration
-------------

New configuration directive will let one :

* Choose whether keywords should be picked from the global keyword scope or per content class
* Choose the maximum amount of autocomplete suggestions

You will find new settings in datatype.ini :

::

  [eZKeywordSettings]
  # Maximum amount of matching keywords returned when autocompleting them.
  # This number should be high enough to fully leverage the 'queryMatchSubset' parameter of YUI's autocomplete component,
  # and consequently drastically reduce the amount of round-trips to the live server.
  MaxAutocompleteResults=100
  #
  # Decide whether to autocomplete keywords per content class or from the global keyword scope.
  # Possible values : enabled OR disabled
  AutocompleteKeywordsPerContentClass=enabled
